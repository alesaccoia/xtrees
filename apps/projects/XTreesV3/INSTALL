Updated Dec 23, 2011
To build this app on osx, this directory has to be placed 2 directory levels deeper than the apps subdirectory of openframeworks v0.07, i.e
of_preRelease_v007_osx/apps/projects/XTreesV3 


The following addons have to be added to the openframeworks addon directory:
ofxControlPanel
ofxOsc
ofxPd (little update necessary, will probably open a ticket in the pdlib forum)
ofxDirList
ofXmlSettings
ofxAppUtils

Some settings of the program are exposed in the data/settings.yml file
